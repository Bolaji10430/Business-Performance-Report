The key product of performance are biro, pencil, and A4 paper because, they maintain the highest level of profit, revenue, and gross sales which contributed to the growth of the organization. Despite more expense in tax and manufacturing costs, they still strive to yield more positive results to the organization.

Notepad and stapler remain poor-performing products due to a drop in sales. It shows in the dashboard where there is dropped down in profit, revenue, and gross sales.
there is no need for me to continue with the product if I still spend more on manufacturing costs, tax, and others while the results always end negatively.
